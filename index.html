        <p>Every time I choose to do the right thing in life, I try 
          to remember that it was you who taught me the merit of that. 
          Thanks for passing on your values as well as your love. It is a fact that you are miles away from me,
           but it is also a fact that despite everything, you are constantly in my heart and mind. I wish you all the best in the years ahead.
           You worked so hard to make sure I could have a better life. You did so much to make sure that we had everything we needed as a family. 
           Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am really proud of you POP, happiest birthday to you.</p>
